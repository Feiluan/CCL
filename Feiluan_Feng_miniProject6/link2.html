    <h2 class="title">Anti-hero</h2>
    <div class="flex-container">

    <div class="part1">
      You know I don't give a damn about what's "right" <br>
      Or pleasing everyone around me <br>
      Cause I know this world that brought us life <br>
      Wasn't made to keep everyone happy <br>
      The rules and laws that countries come up with <br>
      In front of me, they're all shit <br>
      'Cause there are people that I've gotta protect <br>
      And if you get in my way, you're dead <br>
       <br>
      You see I'm tired of trying to justify <br>
      Every decision that I make <br>
      If it's to save the people that I stand by <br>
      You better believe what I say <br>
       <br>
      "Stay in the lines, don't make a scene" <br>
      Heroes try to tell us what's right <br>
      But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean <br>
      I'm ready to start a fight <br>
       <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Feared and hated by everybody <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      So I can save you when the time comes <br>
       <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Feared and hated by everybody <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Yeah <br>
    </div>

    <div class="part2">
      Righteousness is a thing that I hate <br>
      Cause it doesn't do any good for anyone <br>
      And everyone thinks everything is OK <br>
      If they just obey <br>
      I don't want to think about what they see <br>
      When they look up and see evil me <br>
      You see, love isn't what I need <br>
      As long as I can set you free <br>
      <br>
      Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come <br>
      I said bum bum bum, you all better run <br>
      Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come <br>
      So runÔºÅ <br>
      <br>
      "Stay in the lines, don't make a scene" <br>
      Heroes try to tell us what's right <br>
      But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean <br>
      I'm ready to start a fight <br>
      <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Feared and hated by everybody <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      So I can save you when the time comes <br>
      <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Feared and hated by everybody <br>
      I'm gonna be the anti-hero <br>
      Yeah <br>
